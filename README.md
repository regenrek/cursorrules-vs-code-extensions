# Cursor Rules Manager VS Code Extension

![Banner](/images/banner.png)

## Overview

>Attention: This extension is still in the early stages of development. So use it at your own risk.

In the long run, it is tedious to copy and search for cursorrules again and again. That's why I wrote this extension, with which you can easily search and load all rules directly from cursor.directory into cursor.

## Usage

1. Install the extension
2. Open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
3. Search for "Cursor Rules Manager: Search & Add Cursor Rules"
4. Select the rule you want to add


## What are .cursorrules?

With .𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐫𝐫𝐮𝐥𝐞𝐬 you can give instructions to the AI (coding standards, style, etc.).

This helps the AI to understand how you want your code and descriptions to be written.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Quickly search and add through available `.cursorrules` files.
